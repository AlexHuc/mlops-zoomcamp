# MLOps Zoomcamp Project
Welcome to my MLOps Zoomcamp repository. This project demonstrates the application of Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) practices learned throughout the MLOps Zoomcamp course.

# Overview
This repository contains code, configurations, and documentation for implementing MLOps best practices with a focus on taxi trip duration prediction. The project showcases:

## Syllabus
The course consists of structured modules, hands-on workshops, and a final project to reinforce your learning. Each module introduces core MLOps concepts and tools.
